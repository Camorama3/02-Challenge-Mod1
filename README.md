## Description

This webpage is an example of refactoring a webpage. This involves reorganizing CSS so that it's in sequential order corresponding with the HTML file. Comments are also added describing the functions of the CSS. This project was very helpful for me to understand not only the functions of CSS but also HTML and how a webpage is designed and how it's organized.
